    <h1>More Thoughts</h1>
    <p>I want to share a few things that have been on my mind lately. It feels like the same issue keeps coming up, and I just want to be clear about how I feel.</p>
    <p><b>Morning Calls</b>: I’ve noticed that often, you call a third person first thing in the morning, even waking him up before reaching out to me. It leaves me feeling like I’m not your first priority in the mornings, and that affects me.</p>
    <p><b>Frequent Calls</b>: Throughout the day, there are multiple calls and updates shared with this third person, even when I’m right there with you. I don’t understand why there’s this level of responsibility with him, and it’s frustrating for me. I’m not even talking about the personal calls that happen outside of this.</p>
    <p><b>Acting Differently Around Me</b>: When we’re together, it feels like you try to make it seem like you don’t interact much with this third person, which confuses me because I know the reality is different.</p>
    <p><b>Feeling Like I’m Losing Priority</b>: These situations make me feel like I’m losing importance, and that’s my main issue. I don’t think we’ve fought about anything else. If something bothers me, I feel I should be able to express it, just like you do. But what’s bothering me is the lack of clarity from your side, and it leaves me feeling uncertain.</p>
