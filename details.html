    <h1>What's been bothering me</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Morning Priorities:</strong> Often, you call a third person first thing in the morning, waking him up before me. It makes me feel like Iâ€™m not your priority. You also make sure to always add him to plans, and Iâ€™ve noticed sometimes you even ensure heâ€™s ready before we proceed with anything.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Frequent Calls:</strong> Youâ€™ve been calling him multiple times throughout the day, even when you say to me that youâ€™re not available. Whether itâ€™s for nothing or something important, whatâ€™s your commitment to this person to report everything before or after me? If it's simply for casual calls or even for something important, itâ€™s clear that youâ€™re making contact with him more often than with me.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Acting Differently Around Me:</strong> When weâ€™re together, it feels like you act as if you and the third person donâ€™t talk much, which confuses me because I know you do. On top of that, his actions seem really weird and suspicious. He always behaves like a thief, hiding things or acting in a strange way. Why act like this if heâ€™s genuinely just a friend?</li>
      <li><strong>4. Feeling Like Iâ€™m Losing Priority:</strong> These situations make me feel like Iâ€™m losing priority, and thatâ€™s my problem. I donâ€™t think weâ€™ve fought about anything else.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Any of the above is not to blame you, but just to inform you about my problems. I donâ€™t have any hate, but when you ask why Iâ€™m sad, and I say, "not in a good mood," that means Iâ€™m trying to heal. You can check if these 4 points are something Iâ€™ve pointed out from whatâ€™s going on in my mind. If I sketch someone or dislike them, there must be reasons behind it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Iâ€™m adjusting just for you because if something makes you feel okay, but I feel like itâ€™s a problem, that issue remains unresolved for me and doesnâ€™t help me cool down. So, itâ€™s on me to change, and Iâ€™m trying. If you see me angry, just skip me because you already know the reason.</strong></p>
